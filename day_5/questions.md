## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  - An object stores a collection of items. Objects are different from an array on how data is ordered. Data in objects are stored in unordered collection of key and value pairs. Arrays are ordered collections of values only.

2. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
var petStore = {
  dogFood: 70,
  catFood: 6,
  leashes: 50
}
```

3. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```
states.IA
```

4. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?

```
states.MN = "Minnesota"
```

5. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?

  - An object can store multiple different values assigned to keys. 

6. What questions do you still have about objects?
  - No questions just need more practice with objects.
